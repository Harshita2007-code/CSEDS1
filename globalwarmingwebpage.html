      <h2>What is Global Warming?</h2>
        <p>
            Global warming refers to the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system. 
            It is a major aspect of climate change, and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and 
            by measurements of various effects of the warming.
        </p>
        <h2>CAUSES</h2>
        <p> 1.the burning of fossil fuels for energy
            2.deforestation which reduces carbon absorption
            3.industrial processes that release greenhouse gases
            4.agricultural practices like livestock farming and fertilizer use
            5.waste management in landfills
        </p>
        <h2>EFFECTS</h2>
        <p> 1.rising global temperatures, leading to more extreme heat events and wildfires
            2.more severe and intense extreme weather, such as stronger storms, floods, and droughts
            3.rising sea levels due to melting ice and thermal expansion of ocean water, threatening coastal communities
            4.disrupted food and water systems, caused by altered weather patterns and impacts on agriculture and freshwater availability
            </p>
        <h2>WHAT WE CAN DO...</h2>
        <p> Everyone can take action to reduce the effects of global warming. 
            You can reduce energy use, support renewable energy, plant trees, reduce waste, and spread awareness.
